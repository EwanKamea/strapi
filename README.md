Inject the following environment variables:

```bas
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET="<your-token>"
API_TOKEN_SALT="<your-token>"
APP_KEYS="<your-token>,<your-token>,<your-token>,<your-token>"
CC_NODE_BUILD_TOOL="yarn"

#### A PostgreSQL add-on

Environment variables have already been set in the code.

#### A Cellar add-on

This project uses [@strapi/provider-upload-aws-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@strapi/provider-upload-aws-s3) to store assets and has already been set up.

Don't forget to connect your add-ons to the application (**Service dependencies** option from your app menu in Clever Cloud Console).

#### Dedicated build instance

Strapi can run on a small instance like the `XS` plan, but the build process can take more RAM and CPU. Enable a dedicated build instance from your app menu **Information** option in Clever Cloud Console.
